	- Employees
		- Employee Management
			- Employee Lookup
				- List View
					- Employee list only shows once filter is applied and SEARCH button is activated. 
					- It's functional, but a filter feels like it should be applied after a list of employees is given. 
					- A more practical UI would default to showing a list of the current active employees.
					- Keep the toggles for Active/Inactive/All, but make the filter change automatic rather than require the use of a SEARCH
					- Selecting the name should work to open the bottom row options like selecting the checkmark. 
					- The filter via First Name/Last Name/Login works nice
	 
				- New Employee
					- Setting new username/password works
						- Test values used: (username/password)
							(sjt0134/4697!)
							(ADMIN/ADMIN)
							(TEST/TEST)
							(USER/USER)
